    <h4>The Chapel</h4>
    <div>
        <span>"Hello, Ginnie," she heard behind her.</span>
        <p class="try">She paused and turned. A slight colour rose beneath her dusky skin. 
            Ravi Kirjani was tall and lean, and always well-dressed. His black eyes and large 
            white teeth flashed in the sunlight as he spoke. Everyone in Rio Cristalino knew Ravi. 
            Ginnie often heard her unmarried sisters talk ruefully of him, of how, if only their 
            father were alive and they still had land, one of them might marry him. And then 
            they would squabble over who it might be and laugh at Ginnie because she was too simple for any man to want.</p>
